# Vinkius Desktop

## MCPs are the music of AI Agents. We built the player.

The first native desktop application that provides unified MCP server management across all AI clients installed on a single machine.

Today, every AI client stores MCP server configuration in its own file, in its own format, at its own path. Vinkius Desktop eliminates this fragmentation entirely.

## Overview

Vinkius Desktop detects every MCP-compatible AI client on your system, reads their configuration files, and presents a single control surface to manage all of them. Servers are written once and propagated to every client in the correct format — JSON, YAML, or TOML — with the correct transport keys and paths. No manual editing. No duplication. No drift.

The application also provides direct access to the [Vinkius](https://vinkius.com) — a curated registry of hundreds of production-ready MCP servers — with full-text search, category filtering, capability introspection, and one-action setup across all detected clients simultaneously.

## Ecosystem Ubiquity

Vinkius Desktop executes configurations across the entire landscape of modern artificial intelligence tooling. It strictly adheres to each platform's proprietary file structure, deployment paths, and serialization formats without requiring user intervention.

The platform automatically detects and binds to:
- **Integrated Development Environments**: Visual Studio Code, VS Code Insiders, JetBrains, Cursor, Windsurf
- **Autonomous Engineering Agents**: Cline, Cline Insiders, Roo Code, Roo Code Insiders, Continue.dev, Codex
- **Native Desktop & CLI Interfaces**: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Goose by Block, OpenClaw

All environments are continuously monitored. Installation footprints are resolved automatically across Windows, macOS, and Linux architectures. To request integration for an unlisted environment, [open an issue](https://github.com/vinkius-labs/mcp-explorer/issues).
